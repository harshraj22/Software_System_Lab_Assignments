	Q0.  When we run following command 
	     $tar -xvf rollno--midsem.tgz 
	     We should get a directory "rollno--midesm" containing q1.js, q2.php and q3.php (it may have other files). 
	[5 marks]

	Q1. [File name: q1.js] Dictionary Implementation:
	-Create a form, which takes a word as input, on clicking "Search", displays its "meaning". 
	-If the "word" is not present, ask the user to enter the meaning, and store it. Display the search box again. 
	[15 marks]

	Q2. [File name: q2.php] Selection pick up of data from multiple (at least three) files: 
	-Take multiple text files as input as command line arguments to q2.php.
	-Output out.txt with the following specifications:
	 Last line has your roll number. 
	 First line of out.txt is the first line of first text file. 
	 Second line of out.txt is the second line of second text file. 
	 and so on. 
	----Check if "nth" text file has "n" lines. If not insert a blank line in out.txt. 
	----Check for file extension .txt; if it does not have .txt extension, show an error message and exit. 
	 

	----If the file out.txt is not present already, it needs to be created. 
	 
	----Your code could be in multiple files, but we will run q2.php with any number of arguments.

	Q3. [File name:q3.php] Upload and Merge reversed Files: 
	--- Create a form to upload 6 text files (extension ".txt").  
		You can not assume that they have fixed name—ï or they are in some particular location. 
	 
	---Check for file size to be greater than 0KB, and less than 200KB, show an error message and redirect it to upload the file again.
	 
	---Check for file extension .txt; if it does not have .txt extension, show an error message and redirect it to upload the file again.

	-On clicking "submit" button, the text files need to be reversed linewise and merged into a single file named, out.txt

	-On clicking "Download File", the merged file, user should be able to
	download out.txt. 

	----Your code could be in multiple files, but we will run q3.php.
